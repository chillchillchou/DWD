/* This is the transcript of the whole series of Johan Deckman's art project 'Books'.
Text files are transcribed from pictures on Johan Deckman's website: http://deckmann.com/books/
"Books" examine the complications of life through witty one-liners painted on the covers of fictional “self-help” books.
These book titles, though often filled with scathing satire and humor, tackle life’s biggest questions, fears, and absurdities.
